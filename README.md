## Projects

**Simulating Investment Strategies** (for [_early investers_](https://augustmajtenyi.github.io/LifecycleInvesting.html) and [_retirees_](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1-zWkbZO2mmfR0C3_16uwTn6SoKVOny2OcJu-i-yGLlY/edit?usp=sharing))

</kbd>  
Used 40+ years of stock data to simulate high-risk investing with LEAPS (12% annualized ROI) as well as low-risk investing with yearly withdrawals (beating the 4% rule). In both cases, I argue for explicit buy/sell planning and consistent market exposure.  


**NLP Analysis with Unstructured Earnings Calls** ([_slide deck_](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CUsx_gHMNNeO195B45ehTEtIM6fHCL4NptkPNdBgieM/edit?usp=sharing))

NLP with web-scraped, unstructured earnings calls across 4 industries. Includes TF-IDF clustering as well as analyzing AI frequency and sentiment with the Vader package.


**NCSU Women's Tennis Dashboard** ([_full dashboard_](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/august.majtenyi/viz/Blue17NCSUTennisDashboard/NCStatePlayerProfiles))
<kbd>
  <img src="Pictures/Dashboard.JPG" alt="Tableau dashboard overview pic"/>

In collaboration with NCSU coach David Secker, I processed 6 years of tennis stats and visualized 20 requested player metrics. The full dashboard contains 5 pages of different analysis for the indivudal players, leaderboard stats, and WTA points between colleges.


**Analyzing Census Data** ([_repository_](https://github.com/AugustMajtenyi/FoodAccessExploration))

Analyzing public data from the USDA and CDC to identify food deserts. Census-tract data from 2010 and 2015 were visualized with GeoPandas and Matplotlib. This project includes an EBM model that predicts populations having low food access, also clustering analysis within high-need cities.
